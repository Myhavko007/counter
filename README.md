# counter 

This app will count the number of words and characters in the text entered by the user.
Save the code below in an HTML file (e.g., word_counter.html) and open it in your web browser to use the "Word Counter" app.

In this example, the "Word Counter" app includes a text area where the user can enter their text. As the user types or pastes text into the input area, the app updates the word count and character count in real-time.
Feel free to customize the app further, such as adding more features like character excluding spaces, line count, or implementing character limit alerts. You can also enhance the UI by adding styles and improving the overall user experience.
Enjoy using the "Word Counter" app and exploring the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
